# Gaze-Data-from-Web-Searching-Tasks
Contains gaze data from participants with and without autism completing web searching tasks

1. The file "Webtask_github" contains the code used in our experiments.

2. The folder "Gaze Data" contains the following information: 

  1) "Gaze data for both groups for the Search task with Generic AOIs" 
  2) "Gaze data for both groups for the Browse task with Generic AOIs"
  3) "Gaze data for both groups for the Search task with Page-specific AOIs"
  4) "Gaze data for both groups for the Browse task with Page Specific AOIs"
  
Note: The files containing the gaze data for the Page-specific AOIs have an additional column entitles Class. It contains the labels for the participant group (ASD or Control). In the Generic AOIs files this column is missing. Instead, the group labels are given in the User Name columns together with the participant initials as ASD or Control.

3. The file "Success scores plus initials 15 participants" contains the answers of each participant to the web search task. The first tab corresponds to the Control group and the second tab corresponds to the ASD group. Each correct answer is given a score of 1 and each incorrect answer - the score of 0. Since there are two questions per web page, the maximum score per participant per page is 2.

4. The folder "Web Pages" contains screenshots of the 6 web pages used in the study.

5. The folder "Questionnaires and Consent Form" contains the consent form that each participant signed and two questionnaires. One of these questionnaires assesses the overall experience the participants have with using the web and the other one assesses their familiarity with the particular websites that the web pages are from.
